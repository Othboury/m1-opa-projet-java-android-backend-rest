This project is part of a much larger project (Collaborative project) of the Master DID (Développement et Ingénierie des données) at the University of Toulon aiming at developing an android application allowing indoor localization through the Wifi networks thanks to machine learning.

This is a Java application creating a REST API Server using Hibernate (to manage the database) and Jersey, in order to exploit the api urls on the admin side when handling the users (CRUD) and the admins of the indoor localization android application.
